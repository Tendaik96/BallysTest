# Bally‚Äôs Node.js Coding Test

#### Aim
Create a Node.js service that utilises GitHub APIs to allow the client to query GitHub
repositories by name. Create a middleware here and pass through any
responses from GitHub to achieve this goal. Your API should also provide the repository‚Äôs
number of open issues, number of forks etc.


## üõ† Backend Techstack
`NodeJs`, `Express`, `Nodemon`, `ts-node`


## What is Middleware?
Middleware is a software component or function that sits between the client and the server to process incoming requests and responses. It can modify and augment the request and response objects, execute code, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware in the stack.


## Instructions

### üé´ Ticket 1 - Starter files
1. Select a location to place your project and initialize by npm init. Check Node version on computer.
2. `Install Octokit` in accordance to the node version available. See link below: 
    -   https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js/#readme
3. Create a `personal Access token`. This project uses a `Fine-grained` personal access token as it has several security advantages over personal access tokens (classic). (see link below on how the token was created)
    -   https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#fine-grained-personal-access-tokens

4. Install `dotenv` package to store token, and then Install all the other required packages listed below. in the script section, be sure to add a dev entry, This will enable you to start the express server using `nodemon` by running `npm run dev` in the terminal. In your `.gitignore` file add `node_modules` and `.env` as you don't want all of those files being pushed up to GitHub.

    #### Ensure all these packages have been installed
            - Express.js (npm i express)
            - Dotenv (npm i dotenv)
            - TS-node (npm i ts-node)
            - Nodemon (npm i nodemon --save-dev)
            - Types for express (npm i @types/express --save-dev)

5. Create a `models` folder and create a `octokit.ts` file.
6. Create an async function and incorporate the `Search Respositories` api. Ensure parameters and variables have the correct static types (typescript).

    - The function should:
        - take in a single argument, `name` (string)
        - request and return data using octokit function
        - console.log's and return any error if data failed to be retrieved.

7. following a similar layout, create functions which cater to 'Search Respository by ID' and 'Search for readme by Respository ID', using the links below
    - https://api.github.com/repositories/{Id}
    - https://api.github.com/repositories/{Id}/readme
8. Test each function to ensure that data is being passed through.
9. The following files have been created for you in the root of your project:

    - `app.ts` 
    - `.gitignore` 
    -  `tsconfig.json`

### üé´ Ticket 2 - Creating routes
1. Create a `routes` folder, inside create 3 files: `getReadme.ts`, `searchById.ts` and `searchByName.ts`
2. Starting with searchByName.ts, import `express`, `Request` and `Response` from express, and import `searchByName` function from octokit file. Write a request handler to return the correct response and perform the correct action when a `GET` request is received to `/api/repositories/:name` (see api reference section for further details).
3. Ensure all variables and parameters are corretly static typed.
4. export your router and import it in `app.ts`.

    üí° test out the route handler by sending a HTTP GET request via Postman. Don't forget to start the server beforehand `npm run dev`. See `Postman endpoints test` section for URL.

    üí° This endpoint will respond with a array of objects (repositories) that have the same name or include the name you have searched.

4. Repeat the process from step 2 onwards for `getReadme.ts` and `searchById.ts` files, and incorporated corresponding logic for their request handlers, see Api reference section.


### ü•á You've finished!

- üîç Take another look at your code and see if you can refactor anything. <br>
- üìÆ If you do make any changes while refactoring make sure to re-test your routes using Postman.


## API Reference

| HTTP   | Path                   | Response Body                               | Status code | Description                |
| :----- | :-------------------   | :-----------------------------------        | :---------- | :----------------------    |
| GET    | api/repositories/:name    | An array of repositories of a specific name | 200         | Get repositories by name   |
| GET    | api/repositoryDetails/:id | An object of specific repository objects    | 200         | Get repository by ID       |
| GET    | api/getreadme/:id         | An object of specific readme objects        | 200         | Get repository readme by ID|

## Postman endpoints test
    - www.localhost:3000/api/repositories/:name
    - www.localhost:3000/api/repositoryDetails/:id
    - www.localhost:3000/api/getreadme/:id
